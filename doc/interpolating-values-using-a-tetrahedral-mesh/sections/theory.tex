\section{Theory}

Four   different  cases  need  to  be  distinguished:  Normal  tetrahedrons,   a
tetrahedron with one vertex located infinitely far away, a  tetrahedron with two
vertices  located  infinitely  far  away,  and a tetrahedron with three vertices
located infinitely away.

The barycentric coordinates of a 3D point in space  need  to be computed for all
cases. Additionally, a method  for  checking  boundaries  needs to exist for all
cases. Two 4x4 transformation  matrices  are  proposed  to  generalise these two
requirements. The construction of these matrices is different in every case, and
is described in detail in the following sections.
